Fortifying the Fortress: Exploring Offensive and Defensive Strategies in Cybersecurity
Understanding cybersecurity requires first an understanding of how to defend against the various types of common cyberattacks from nefarious code being introduced into the software supply chain to penetration attacks and network breaches. But building a strong defense system will not be enough. Organizations will need to start thinking of ‘offensive’ strategies to complete the picture. Join Caroline Wong as she breaks down implementing defensive techniques supported by offensive strategies.

Caroline Wong is the Chief Strategy Officer at Cobalt.io. She has 15+ years of cybersecurity leadership, including practitioner, product, and consulting roles. Caroline authored the popular textbook, Security Metrics: A Beginner’s Guide. She teachers cybersecurity courses on LinkedIn Learning and hosts the Humans of InfoSec podcast.
