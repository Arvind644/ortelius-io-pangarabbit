Generating security insights like SBOMs is not enough to harden your software supply chain. Consumption and analysis of the data is needed to rapidly respond to supply chain threats. IT teams struggle to respond to threats when this critical security intelligence is fragmented across tools and DevOps Pipelines. Without centralized insights it is impossible to know where a particular high-risk vulnerability is running across the entire organization because the data is managed at the container level.

The mission of the Ortelius community is to defend the software supply chain by leveraging the open-source software security intelligence already generated across the DevOps pipeline using a central evidence store. In addition, Ortelius's centralized data is the catalyst for software supply chain threat modeling. 

With Ortelius, you can easily answer the question, "where is Log4J running?"

The latest version of Ortelius is maintained by the Ortelius Community managed by the [Continuous Delivery Foundation](cd.foundation), part of the Linux Foundation. Corporate support comes from DeployHub with 80% of the codebase from DeployHub's [Software Supply Chain Security Platform](www.deployhub.com).

## Abraham Ortelius – Our Inspiration

<div class="wrapdiv">
<img class="wrapdiv_image" src="images/abrahamortelius.jpg" alt="Abraham Ortelius" style="width:121px; height:170px" />
<p class="wrapdiv_text">Abraham Ortelius made his name by collecting data from scientists, geographers, and cartographers of his time and transforming it into what the world now knows as a world Atlas. His Atlas, titled Theatrum Orbis Terrarum (Theatre of the World), was published on May 20, 1570. His Atlas disrupted the way the world was seen, with the first concepts imagining continental drift. Also of interest are the sea monsters shown in the water – mythical creatures that were a subject of fascination in Ortelius’ generation.</p>

## A Thought Leader in Sharing
Ortelius also in some ways created on open source community of his day. To accomplish his goal, he was the first cartographers to give credit to his fellow scientists by adding their names to the Atlas. Ortelius was known to have corresponded with other professionals throughout Europe and pulled together their knowledge to create his publication and a truly global view of the world.

Thank you Abraham Ortelius for showing us the way.
