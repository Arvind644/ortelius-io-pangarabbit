<h1 class="text-center">Centralized DevOps and Security Evidence for Rapid Software Supply Chain Attack Response </h1>
<hr>
</div>

Today’s software security tools gather data for mostly low-level objects, like containers, causing critical security intelligence to be fragmented and stored across siloed logs and tools. Responding to a software supply chain security threat requires consolidated evidence that shows a high-risk vulnerability's impact across the entire organization. Ortelius continuously monitors the updates to your organization's software supply chain, tracking open-source inventory, and providing insights on impact and usage. In addition, the  Ortelius historical trend analysis is the basis for tomorrow's threat modeling with automated rapid response.

The mission of the Ortelius community is to defend the software supply chain by leveraging the open-source software security intelligence already generated across the DevOps pipeline, and to create AI threat models for rapid supply chain attack response. 

Ortelius is an evidence store that federates supply chain and DevOps intelligence generated across the DevOps pipeline, providing an end-to-end view of an organization's security profile. Ortelius tracks and versions DevOps and security details for every component of your software supply chain. This data is then collected and aggregated to the 'logical' applications, organizational Domains, and deployed environments giving you a sweeping view of your organization's security insights. With Ortelius, you can easily answer the question, "where is Log4J running?"

The latest version of Ortelius is maintained by the Ortelius Community managed by the [Continuous Delivery Foundation](http://cd.foundation/) (Linux Foundation). Corporate support comes from DeployHub with 80% of the codebase from DeployHub's [Software Supply Chain Security](https://www.deployhub.com/) Platform.

## Abraham Ortelius – Our Inspiration

<div class="wrapdiv">
<img class="wrapdiv_image" src="images/abrahamortelius.jpg" alt="Abraham Ortelius" style="width:121px; height:170px" />
<p class="wrapdiv_text">Abraham Ortelius made his name by collecting data from scientists, geographers, and cartographers of his time and transforming it into what the world now knows as a world Atlas. His Atlas, titled Theatrum Orbis Terrarum (Theatre of the World), was published on May 20, 1570. His Atlas disrupted the way the world was seen, with the first concepts imagining continental drift. Also of interest are the sea monsters shown in the water – mythical creatures that were a subject of fascination in Ortelius’ generation.</p>

## A Thought Leader in Sharing
Ortelius also in some ways created on open source community of his day. To accomplish his goal, he was the first cartographers to give credit to his fellow scientists by adding their names to the Atlas. Ortelius was known to have corresponded with other professionals throughout Europe and pulled together their knowledge to create his publication and a truly global view of the world.

Thank you Abraham Ortelius for showing us the way.
