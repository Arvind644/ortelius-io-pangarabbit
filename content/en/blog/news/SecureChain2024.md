<h2 class="text-left">Fortifying the Fortress: Exploring Offensive and Defensive Strategies in Cybersecurity</h2>

Understanding cybersecurity requires first an understanding of how to defend against the various types of common cyberattacks from nefarious code being introduced into the software supply chain to penetration attacks and network breaches. But building a strong defense system will not be enough. Organizations will need to start thinking of 'offensive' strategies to complete the picture. Join Caroline Wong as she breaks down implementing defensive techniques supported by offensive strategies.
