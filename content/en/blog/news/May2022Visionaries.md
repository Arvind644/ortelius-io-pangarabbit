## An Amazing Community of Committers

On May 20th, 2022 the Ortelius community will host our 4th 'Microservice Visionaries' gathering to celebrate the community committers of Ortelius, discuss microservice best practices, and drive awareness of the benefits and challenges of implementing a truly shared microservice oriented architecture. We host the majority of the event on the Ortelius Twitch TV Channel giving our committers a platform for presenting technical topics. The first hour is hosted via zoom. Below are descriptions of the May 20th event. 

## Agenda: (all times in MT)

### 9:00 AM - 10:00 AM Beer and Donuts 
This live Zoom event kicks off the Visionaries gathering. Meet the contributors and see who earned committer badges. There are 3 categories, Ambassador, Champions and Legends.

## Ortelius Twitch Channel Schedule
The following presentation will be on the [Ortelius Twitch Channel](https://www.twitch.tv/orteliusos). 

### 10 AM  - 10:20 AM Panel Discussion
<strong>The Evolution of a Microservice Catalog</strong>
<br>
Join a panel of Ortelius Contributors to learn what it means to be part of the Ortelius team, what is in the Ortelius roadmap and general conversation about the work ahead. Sacha Wharton, Steve Taylor, Tracy Ragan


## Ten minute lighting talks on the Ortelius Twitch Channel  - Hosted by Sergio Canales

<p><strong> 10:25 AM What you should know to contribute to Ortelius - a 10 minute guide</strong> 
<br><strong>Presented by Saim Safder</strong>
<br>
If you are into the world of microservices and looking for ways to contribute, you have found your match.  The Ortelius microservices-based open source project is the place to be to share your knowledge around open-source, or to learn how to get started on your microservice journey. This lightning talk covers the steps you need to start contributing to the Ortelius  Open Source project and learn about microservices at the same time. </p>
<br>
  
<p><strong> 10:40 AM  Developing Applications with the Microservices Architecture: Design Patterns </strong>
<br><strong>Presented by Utkarsh Sharma</strong>
<br>
In this lighting talk, we will share famous design patterns that are widely used. We will cover design patterns used during the decomposition of monoliths and those that are used to ensure data consistency across microservices. These design patterns are developed to solve traditional problems faced with microservice architecture. Building your solution on top of these patterns provides resilience, tolerance, and consistency to your application.</p>
<br>

<p><strong> 10:55 AM Pitfalls - Team Topologies from the field </strong>
<br><strong>Presented by Sergio Canales</strong>
<br> 
Team Topologies are the leading approach to organizing business and technology teams for fast flow, providing a practical, step-byâ€‘step, adaptive model for organizational design and team interaction.Let's talk from the field how this comes into reality.</p>
<br>

<strong>Break 11:10 AM to 11:20 AM </strong>

<p><strong> 11:20 AM Why do you need a microservice catalog to enhance developer productivity?
 </strong>
<br><strong>Presented by Turja Narayan Chaudhuri</strong>
<br>
It is indeed a valid argument that microservices allows engineering organization to grow and scale, providing better constructs for isolation and independence. But, microservices do not only add technical complexity -they also introduce organizational complexity and pose a serious threat to scaling at the enterprise level. Over time, with hundreds of services and no governance or oversight, when something breaks, nobody knows who to reach out to. A microservice catalog is a record/list of all the microservices that an enterprise has in its ecosystem, providing powerful information at your fingertips. In this talk, you will learn how a microservice catalog facilitates a successful microservice at scale architecture by helping developers find and share services, providing DevOps teams metadata about services needed to make solid decisions, and give the support teams the ownership and consumption information needed when something goes wrong.</p>

</p><strong> 11:35 AM Microservices and the CD Pipeline</strong>
<br><strong>Presented by Deepesh Nellutla </strong>
<br>
Learn what is needed to follow best practices for building a microservice based CD Pipeline. Your pipeline will be disrupted as each team is independently developing and deploying microservices. In this session we will explore what changes will be required to adapt to a microservice architecture.</p>

</p><strong> 11:50 AM Why Kubernetes-as-a-Service is better for you?
</strong>
<br><strong>Presented by Pavan Gudiwada</strong>
<br>
Using Kubernetes-as-a-Service from a cloud provider could be the best way for you to develop your application. What is KaaS? Why and when should you use it? What should you know before you pick a provider? Join this session to learn the answers.

<br>
<p><strong> 12:50 AM - SBOMs for All Using Ortelius</strong>
<br><strong>Presented by Steve Taylor</strong>
<br>
Hardening cybersecurity in cloud-native environments means we need to track not just service SBOMs, but more importantly application SBOMs. In a de-coupled architecture it can be almost impossible to create an application SBOM - Steve Taylor will show us how Ortelius gets this job done so everyone has an SBOM.
