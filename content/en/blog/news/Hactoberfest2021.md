## Where to Find an Issue to Work on
We have created a [Hacktoberfest 2021 Project](https://github.com/ortelius/ortelius/projects/5) and assigned GitHub Issues to the project. These Issues are ideal candidates for creating your Hacktoberfest pull request. You are not required to work only under the Hacktoberfest 2021 Project. You can choose any issue. If you choose an issue outside of the Hactoberfest 2021 project you will need to create your pull request with the field called 'Label' using the keyword 'Hacktoberfest' so it can be recognized.


## Suggested Issues

In the 'Subject' of the Issue, the type of work that needs to be done is described. For example, documentation, microservice, GitOps, website, or blogs. This is intended to make it easier to search for something that may be of interest. Following are suggested issues for Hacktoberfest.
