## Purpose for Ortelius Documentation Project
The following information is for the Ortelius open-source community to explore the application process to [Google Season of Docs](https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/). Ortelius is a new incubating project under the [Continuous Delivery Foundation](cd.foundation).  The current documentation has a good structure, but much of the content is presented in isolation. In addition, there are gaps/weaknesess around clarity, completeness of information, and is generally ambiguous in terms of for whom the information is written. The result is documentation that is not always suitable for the intended audience. In particular, there is a bit too much assumed knowledge within the documentation which does not facilitate learning or improving the user's skill set. In order to improve the onboarding of Ortelius, this primary documentation issue must be addressed.

Ortelius Documentation Repository - [https://github.com/ortelius/ortelius-docs](https://github.com/ortelius/ortelius-docs)

The following documentation project is presented for the Google Season of Docs:

### Persona Skill Set Development

The existing documentation has a substantial amount of content which works well for someone who has a deep technical understanding and simply needs the documentation for reference. The core problem with the documentation is that it is not usable for developing a skill set in Ortelius. The result is new users of Ortelius struggle with on-boarding and adoption of the solution.

The Ortelius community is submitting to be included in the GSoD to address this specific area. We will seek a technical writer who can enhance the documentation to address the persona weakness. This will include identifying which personas are consuming the documentation, with a view of aligning documentation content accordingly.

To simplify the adoption of Ortelius, the technical writer will be tasked with documenting a clear beginner path with the deeper technical material being used as references. There is currently a starting point for this effort in the installation/getting started sections, but this information should be more prominent and framed within the larger context of what value Ortelius is providing.

By enhancing the documentation as a skill building reference, we can improve the end user experience from the first hour through full implementation. In addition, end users will be provided basic insights on how Ortelius solves core issues common in microservice management.

### Specific Technical Writer Statement of Work Deliverable:

- <strong>Persona Selection</strong> - The Ortelius team has previously defined a set of user 'personas.' The technical writer will work with these personas to identify the precise consumers of the documentation.
- <strong>Core Documentation Updates</strong> - The focus of the documentation will be to improve upon the 'first hour' experience of the persona. This will involve updating the existing documentation to make the language more approachable, and the path through the documentation more clear. The precise sections of the documentation to be addressed will include:
    - [Welcome Section](https://docs.ortelius.io/guides/userguide/introduction/)
    - [Key Concepts](https://docs.ortelius.io/guides/userguide/concepts/)
    - [First Steps](https://docs.ortelius.io/guides/userguide/first-steps/)
- <strong>Two Tiers</strong> -The technical writer must create 'two tiers' of technical documentation with a clear relationship. The high level view and the technical reference view. The high level view would have more of a focus on where things sit in relation to the rest of Ortelius, as opposed to a more narrow explanation of just that concept.
- <strong>Mark Down - </strong> All technical documentation will be delivered in Mark Down language.
- <strong>Reorganization</strong> - If reorganization of the documentation is required, the technical writer will need to perform the reorganization work.

### Measuring Success of the GSoD Project

1) Ease of onboarding - currently new users must rely on the Ortelius Community to get basic questions answered for their first hour or day of using Ortelius. We can measure the success of the documentation by an increase in adoption with a decrease in 'support' related questions.
2) Survey - We will survey the documentation quality/approachability through the Ortelius Community asking for feedback on the enhancements.

### Working with the Technical Writer
The Ortelius community will identify 3 members from the community to review the updated documentation to provide ongoing feedback if the goal - clarity for new end users - is are being achieved and provide course correction of needed.

### Person Hours and Budget Requirements
Based on the existing content, the following time estimates are assumed:
- 4 hours - Persona selection
- 80 hours - Core documentation updates
- 30 hours - Two Tiers, ensuring documentation provides a high level view with a more narrow explanation. 
- 10 hours - Reorganization if required.

Total - 124 hours

<strong>Total Budget $9,300</strong>
