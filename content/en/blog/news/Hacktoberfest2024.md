## Where to Find an Issue to Work On

We have created a Hacktoberfest GitHub label so you can easily get credit for your pull requests. Issues with the Hacktoberfest label were created for Hacktoberfest participants, and many are ideal candidates for first time contributors. 

 You are not required to work only on issues with the Hacktoberfest label. You can choose any issue that works for you. If you choose an issue outside of the Hacktoberfest project you will need to create your pull request with the field called 'Label' using the keyword 'Hacktoberfest' so it can be recognized.
