## Utkarsh Sharma Awarded Gold Legend Badge

Utkarsh Sharma, a core Ortelius contributor, earned the coveted Gold Legend Badge for his outstanding work in both the Champion and Ambassador Ortelius contributor programs. This badge is particularly difficult to earn as it requires achieving goals in both code and technical contributions as well as work in DevRel and community outreach. Congratulations Utkarsh for a job well done.
