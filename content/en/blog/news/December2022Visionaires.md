## Ten Minute Lighting Talks - Hosted by Sergio Canales

<strong>12:00 -12:10 PM The Ortelius Evidence Store of SBOMs</strong>
<strong>Presented by Tracy Ragan</strong><br>
Generating an SBOM for a decomposed application can be a massive undertaking. Each dependency has its own build, SBOM and CVE. Creating a single SBOM for the application as a complete software system requires knowing the dependencies and pulling together all of the unique SBOMs into one. Ortelius makes this easy by integrating into your CD Pipeline to store and aggregate this level of information for every logical release candidate. Tracy shows us how it is done.</p>
