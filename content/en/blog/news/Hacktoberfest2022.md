## Get your Coding On!

The Ortelius open-source community will participate in its 3rd annual Hacktoberfest. Last year the team completed 27 pull request, got lots of documentation completed and tied up many loose ends. We thank Digital Ocean for hosting this amazing event each year. We look forward to having many of you get your first Hacktoberfest T-shirt!

## Getting Started
Here is how to get started:

- [Register for Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/register/)

- Join our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/wM4b5yEFzS).

- Watch Steve Taylor's video on setting up your [Local Dev Enviornment.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7r-jp9ZmTE&list=PLjQ1l9KZoIQ39x2230RCUZM8ZlRT1-rp4) 

## Where to Find an Issue to Work On
We have created a [Hacktoberfest 2022 Project](https://github.com/ortelius/ortelius/projects/5) and assigned GitHub Issues to the project. These Issues are ideal candidates for creating your Hacktoberfest pull request. You are not required to work only under the Hacktoberfest Project. You can choose any issue. If you choose an issue outside of the Hacktoberfest project you will need to create your pull request with the field called 'Label' using the keyword 'Hacktoberfest' so it can be recognized.


## Suggested Issues

In the 'Subject' of the Issue, the type of work that needs to be done is described. For example, documentation, microservice, GitOps, website, or blogs. This is intended to make it easier to search for something that may be of interest. Following are suggested issues.
