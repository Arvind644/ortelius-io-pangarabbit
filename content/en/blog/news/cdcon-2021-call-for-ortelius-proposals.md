cdCon 2021 is your chance to share what you’ve been doing with Ortelius! Have you been simplifying the adoption of modern architecture through microservices? Are you building something cool? Using it to solve real-world problems? Are you making things fast? Secure? Or maybe you’re a contributor and want to share what’s new. In all cases, we want to hear from you!
